# Bertelsmann Arvato Project

# Project Overview
In this project, we are provided with demographic data of customers of a mail-order company in Germany and demographic data of general population of Germany. Using this data, we are required to identify new customers for the company.

We approach this project in 2 phases:

Use Unsupervised Learning to perform customer segmentation and identify clusters/segments from general population who best match mail-order company's customer base.
Use Supervised Learning to identify targets for marketing campaign of the mail-order company who could possibly become their customers.
Goal of this project is to predict individuals who are most likely to become customers for a mail-order sales company in Germany.
